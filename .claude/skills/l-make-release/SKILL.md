# /l-make-release

End-to-end release orchestrator for the `@takazudo/zudo-ogp-check-panel` npm package. It bumps the
version, prepends a changelog section, commits + pushes, waits for CI, validates the
package, pushes the `v*` tag (which triggers `.github/workflows/release.yml` →
`pnpm -r publish`), then creates the GitHub Release. The single human gate is the
Step 3 proposal — confirming it authorizes the whole flow through publish.

The single published package is `@takazudo/zudo-ogp-check-panel` (`packages/zocp/package.json`) —
the **version source-of-truth**. The workspace **root** `package.json` is private and
stays as-is — do NOT bump or touch it.

## Invocation & confirmation

This skill is **model-invocable**: a rough natural-language request like "bump
version", "cut a release", or "make npm release" may trigger it. **It must never
mutate anything before the user explicitly confirms.** Steps 1–3 are read-only
(preconditions, version computation, change analysis); the first mutation is Step 4.

There is **one gate**: the Step 3 proposal (current → new version + categorized
changelog). Confirming it authorizes the entire flow — bump, push, tag, publish,
and GitHub Release. Do **not** add a second "push the tag now?" prompt; the user
already decided at Step 3. The only thing that can halt the flow after Step 3 is a
**validation failure** (Step 6) — see Boundaries.

If the trigger was a loose phrase, restate the proposed bump plainly at Step 3 so
the user can catch a wrong version strategy before anything is written.

## Boundaries

- The skill **does** push the `v*` tag and **does** create the GitHub Release — but
  only after the Step 3 confirmation. It never bypasses that confirmation.
- A **publint** validation failure (Step 6) aborts the flow **before** any tag is
  pushed — npm cannot re-publish a version, so a broken package must never reach the
  registry. **attw** output is advisory and does not block.
- The skill touches only `packages/zocp/CHANGELOG.md` for the changelog. It does
  **not** touch the repo-root `CHANGELOG.md`.
- The skill never runs `npm publish` directly — publishing is `release.yml`'s job,
  triggered by the tag push.

## How release.yml publishes (context, do NOT modify it)

`.github/workflows/release.yml` triggers on `push` of any `v*` tag. It builds the
package and runs `pnpm -r publish` with a dist-tag derived from the tag name:

- Tag matching `-next.*`, `-beta.*`, or `-rc.*` → npm dist-tag **`next`**
- All other `v*` tags → npm dist-tag **`latest`**

Prerelease consumers opt in with `pnpm add @takazudo/zudo-ogp-check-panel@next`.

Publish auth comes from the **`NPM_TOKEN`** GitHub Actions repo secret (an
Automation-type npm token, which bypasses 2FA in unattended CI). If a Release run
fails at the publish step with an auth/`ENEEDAUTH`/2FA error, that secret is missing
or expired — check `gh secret list` and re-add it (`gh secret set NPM_TOKEN`).

## Step 1: Preconditions

Before doing anything else, verify the following. If a check fails, stop with a
clear message.

1. Current branch is `main` (`git branch --show-current`).
2. `gh` CLI is authenticated (`gh auth status`).

### Resume detection (run this before requiring a clean tree)

A previous run — or a manual edit — may have already committed the version bump
without pushing the tag. Detect that state before assuming a cold start:

```bash
git fetch --tags origin
CUR=$(node -p "require('./packages/zocp/package.json').version")
git tag -l "v$CUR"   # empty output = no tag yet for the current version
```

- **If `v$CUR` does NOT exist** and the working tree is clean: the current version
  is un-tagged. Locate the actual commit that set this version — do NOT assume it is
  `HEAD`:

  ```bash
  # The commit that introduced the current version string (the bump commit)
  BUMP_SHA=$(git log -1 --format=%H -S"\"version\": \"$CUR\"" -- packages/zocp/package.json)
  ```

  Tell the user the bump for `v$CUR` is already committed (`$BUMP_SHA`) and offer to
  **RESUME**. Resuming skips Steps 2–5 (bump / changelog / commit) and continues
  from **Step 5** (CI wait) onward — tagging **`$BUMP_SHA`** (not `HEAD`) — through
  the same validate → push tag → publish → GitHub Release path as a cold start.
  The resume confirmation is the gate (it stands in for Step 3).

  **Guard against a moved HEAD**: if `$BUMP_SHA` is not the current `HEAD`
  (`git rev-parse HEAD`), commits landed after the bump. Surface this and let the
  user choose: (a) tag `$BUMP_SHA` as-is so the release matches the bumped version
  exactly, or (b) abort and start a fresh bump (Steps 2–5) so the newer commits are
  included and the changelog reflects them. Never silently tag `HEAD` under the old
  version.
- **If `v$CUR` already exists**: the current version is released. Proceed with a
  normal cold-start bump (Steps 2–5).

Require a **clean working tree** (`git status --porcelain` empty) only on the
cold-start (bump) path. On the resume path the tree is already clean — do not
re-bump.

## Step 2: Determine Next Version

Read the current version from `packages/zocp/package.json` (the source-of-truth).
Apply these rules based on the optional argument:

### No argument

- If current is `X.Y.Z-next.N` (prerelease): propose `X.Y.Z-next.{N+1}`
  - Example: `0.1.0-next.2` → `0.1.0-next.3`
- If current is stable `X.Y.Z`: propose `X.{Y+1}.0-next.1`
  - Example: `0.1.0` → `0.2.0-next.1`

### `next` argument (from stable)

- Force-start a new minor prerelease: `X.{Y+1}.0-next.1`
- Example: `0.1.0` → `0.2.0-next.1`

### `major` argument

- Bump major, reset minor+patch, start prerelease: `{X+1}.0.0-next.1`
- Example: `0.1.0-next.5` → `1.0.0-next.1`, `0.1.0` → `1.0.0-next.1`

### `minor` argument

- Bump minor, reset patch, start prerelease: `X.{Y+1}.0-next.1`
- Example: `0.1.0-next.5` → `0.2.0-next.1`, `0.1.0` → `0.2.0-next.1`

### `patch` argument

- Bump patch, start prerelease: `X.Y.{Z+1}-next.1`
- Example: `0.1.0-next.5` → `0.1.1-next.1`, `0.1.0` → `0.1.1-next.1`

### `stable` argument

- Strip the `-next.N` suffix from the current prerelease.
- Requires the current version to be a `-next.N` prerelease. If it is already
  stable, stop with an error.
- Example: `0.1.0-next.5` → `0.1.0`

## Step 3: Analyze Changes and Propose — THE GATE

Find the latest version tag. Fetch remote tags first — a prior release may have
created its `v*` tag only on the remote, so the most recent tag can be absent from
this local checkout. Without the fetch, `git tag -l` picks a stale older tag and
the changelog base re-includes already-released commits:

```bash
git fetch --tags origin
LAST_TAG=$(git tag -l 'v*' --sort=-v:refname | head -1)
git log "$LAST_TAG"..HEAD --oneline
```

Categorize each commit by its conventional-commit prefix:

- **Breaking Changes**: commits with `!` suffix (e.g. `feat!:`) or `BREAKING CHANGE`
  in the body
- **Features**: `feat:` prefix
- **Bug Fixes**: `fix:` prefix
- **Other Changes**: everything else (`docs:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, `ci:`,
  `test:`, `style:`, `perf:`, etc.)

Present the proposal to the user:

```
Proposed bump: {current} → {new} ({type})

Breaking Changes:
- description (hash)

Features:
- description (hash)

Bug Fixes:
- description (hash)

Other Changes:
- description (hash)
```

Only show sections that have entries. **Wait for user confirmation before
proceeding.** Confirming here authorizes the full flow through `npm publish` and the
GitHub Release — the only thing that can stop it afterward is a validation failure
(Step 6).

## Step 4: Bump + Changelog

### 4a. Update packages/zocp/package.json

Update the `version` field in `packages/zocp/package.json` to the confirmed new
version (without the `v` prefix). Do NOT touch the workspace root `package.json`.

### 4b. Prepend a changelog section

`packages/zocp/CHANGELOG.md` is version-sectioned markdown: a `# Changelog` header,
then `## <version>` sections newest-first, each with `### Fixed` / `### Features` /
etc. subsections. Insert the new `## <version>` section **immediately after the
`# Changelog` header**, above the previous newest version.

Format:

```md
## <version>

### Breaking Changes

- description (hash)

### Features

- description (hash)

### Fixed

- description (hash)

### Other Changes

- description (hash)
```

Rules:

- Only include subsections that have entries.
- Each entry: commit subject followed by the short hash in parentheses.
- Link issues/PRs where the reference is obvious from the commit subject (e.g.
  `([#1](https://github.com/Takazudo/zudo-ogp-check-panel/pull/1))`).

### 4c. Refresh the lockfile

```bash
pnpm install
```

This regenerates `pnpm-lock.yaml` so CI's `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` succeeds.

**Lockfile drift heuristic** — before staging, surface added/removed lines that are
NOT simple two-space-indented entries (those are the expected version-line churn):

```bash
# PCRE (GNU grep -P / ripgrep): show +/- lines that are NOT two-space-indented
git diff pnpm-lock.yaml | grep -P '^[+-](?!  )' | head -20
# Portable fallback (BSD/macOS grep lacks -P):
# git diff pnpm-lock.yaml | awk '/^[+-]/ && !/^[+-]  / { print }' | head -20
```

If you see non-version-related structural changes, stop and surface the diff to the
user before proceeding.

## Step 5: Atomic Commit + Push

Stage and commit the bumped files in a **single commit**:

```bash
git add packages/zocp/package.json packages/zocp/CHANGELOG.md pnpm-lock.yaml
git commit -m "chore(release): bump to v<version>"
git push origin main
```

Record the resulting commit SHA:

```bash
BUMP_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
```

## Step 6: Wait for CI on the Bump Commit

Delegate CI polling to the `/watch-ci` skill — do NOT reimplement polling:

```
Skill(skill="watch-ci", args="--branch main --commit <BUMP_SHA>")
```

`/watch-ci` is a user-global skill, not a repo-local one. If it is unavailable in
the running session, fall back to a direct poll:

```bash
gh run watch "$(gh run list --branch main --commit <BUMP_SHA> --limit 1 --json databaseId -q '.[0].databaseId')" --exit-status
```

If CI fails, fix the issue, re-push, then re-watch before proceeding.

## Step 7: Pre-publish Package Validation (publint blocks, attw advises)

npm cannot re-publish a version, so catch packaging mistakes **before** the tag is
pushed. Build locally first so validation inspects what `release.yml` will actually
publish (the CI publish runs its own build via `prepublishOnly` — this local build
is only to produce `dist/` for validation here):

```bash
pnpm -F @takazudo/zudo-ogp-check-panel build
cd packages/zocp
```

Run `publint` — this **blocks**. publint findings on this ESM-only package are almost
always real bugs (a path in `exports` that doesn't exist, a file referenced but
missing from the `files` whitelist):

```bash
pnpm dlx publint
```

If `publint` reports errors, **stop and surface them**. Do NOT push the tag — fix
the packaging issue, commit + push, re-run CI (Step 6), and re-validate.

Run `attw` and `pnpm pack` for **human review only** — do not block on them. `attw`
is built around dual ESM/CJS packages and may emit noise on an ESM-only package;
read its output, but a clean `publint` is the gate:

```bash
pnpm dlx @arethetypeswrong/cli --pack .       # advisory — review, do not block
pnpm pack --pack-destination /tmp             # then inspect the tarball contents:
tar -tzf /tmp/takazudo-zudo-ogp-check-panel-<version>.tgz | sort
cd ../..                                       # return to repo root
```

Confirm the tarball contains `dist/`, `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `LICENSE`, and
`package.json` — and nothing unexpected (no `src/`, no tests, no `.map` files).

## Step 8: Push the Tag (triggers the publish)

Mint the tag on the bump commit and push it — the push is what fires `release.yml`:

```bash
git tag "v<version>" <BUMP_SHA>
git push origin "v<version>"
```

Then watch the Release workflow to success:

```bash
RELEASE_RUN=$(gh run list --workflow release.yml --branch "v<version>" --limit 1 --json databaseId -q '.[0].databaseId')
gh run watch "$RELEASE_RUN" --exit-status
```

If the Release workflow fails, surface the failing logs (`gh run view "$RELEASE_RUN" --log-failed`)
and stop — the npm publish did not complete. Do not create the GitHub Release until
the publish succeeds.

## Step 9: Create the GitHub Release + Verify, then STOP

Extract the just-released changelog section as notes (this awk pattern works whether
the section is first or in the middle of the file), then create the Release. The tag
already exists on the remote, so use `--verify-tag`. Add `--prerelease` for a
`-next.` / `-beta.` / `-rc.` version:

```bash
awk '/^## <version>/{f=1;next} f&&/^## /{exit} f' packages/zocp/CHANGELOG.md > /tmp/zocp-release-notes.md
PRERELEASE_FLAG=$([[ "<version>" =~ -next\.|-beta\.|-rc\. ]] && echo "--prerelease" || echo "")
gh release create "v<version>" --verify-tag --title "v<version>" $PRERELEASE_FLAG \
  --notes-file /tmp/zocp-release-notes.md
```

Confirm the publish landed under the expected dist-tag:

```bash
npm dist-tag ls @takazudo/zudo-ogp-check-panel
npm view "@takazudo/zudo-ogp-check-panel@<version>" version
```

The version should appear under **`next`** for a prerelease, **`latest`** for a
stable release.

**Warn-only dist-tag check**: if a **prerelease** version is showing under `latest`
(or `latest` points at an older prerelease — a known artifact of the very first
publish), surface a warning. Do NOT auto-fix — moving a dist-tag is a registry-level
mutation that deserves a human. The manual fix is:

```bash
npm dist-tag rm @takazudo/zudo-ogp-check-panel latest        # remove a stray prerelease from latest
# (or repoint it once a real stable ships: npm dist-tag add @takazudo/zudo-ogp-check-panel <stable> latest)
```

Print a final report: published version + dist-tag, the npm tarball URL, the Release
workflow run, and the GitHub Release URL. Then **STOP**.

## Failure Recovery

### pnpm-lock.yaml drift (Step 4c)

Run the drift heuristic before staging. If non-version structural changes appear,
stop and surface the diff. Resolve the lockfile manually before re-running.

### CI fails on the bump commit (Step 6)

Fix the issue, commit the fix, push, then re-watch CI. Do not validate or tag until
CI is green.

### publint validation fails (Step 7)

Stop before tagging. Fix the packaging issue (`exports` path, missing file in
`files`, etc.), commit + push, re-run CI (Step 6), and re-validate. Nothing is
published yet, so this is fully recoverable.

### Release workflow fails after the tag was pushed (Step 8)

The tag exists on the remote but the npm publish did not complete. Inspect
`gh run view "$RELEASE_RUN" --log-failed`. If the failure is transient (registry
hiccup), re-run the workflow: `gh run rerun "$RELEASE_RUN"`. If the fix needs a code
change, the tag must move to a new commit — delete and re-cut: `git push origin
:refs/tags/v<version>` (delete remote tag), `git tag -d v<version>`, fix, then
re-run `/l-make-release` (which will resume or cut a new version). A version that
already published successfully cannot be re-published — cut a new version instead.

### Rolling back a bad bump (before the tag was pushed)

If the bump commit needs to be undone:

```bash
git revert <BUMP_SHA>
git push origin main
```

Then remove the prepended `## <version>` section from `packages/zocp/CHANGELOG.md`
(the revert restores `package.json` and `pnpm-lock.yaml`, but verify the changelog
section is gone), delete the local tag if minted (`git tag -d v<version>`), and
re-run `/l-make-release` from the start.
